'''
- heyrob.py as an entry point, accepting "test"
- listen.py as the listener, both local and on web
- understand.py as the interpreter from the audio into a decision
- takeaction.py as the one who triggers the actions possible

all of them should be interchangeable
  (e.g.: if I want to test a better listener,
   I should be able to just point to that one)

all of them should use logging
